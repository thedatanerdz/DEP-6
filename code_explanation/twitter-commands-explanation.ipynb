It will update the package lists, install the required Python packages (apache-airflow, pandas, s3fs, and tweepy) using pip.\n\nAfter the script completes successfully, you should have Apache Airflow, pandas, s3fs, and tweepy installed on your system, along with their dependencies.\n\nPlease note that using sudo in scripts can be potentially dangerous, as it grants elevated privileges to the commands. Make sure you understand the implications and only run scripts from trusted sources. Additionally, if you are on a system that does not use apt-get as the package manager (e.g., macOS), the package installation commands may differ, and you need to adapt the script accordingly.","metadata":{}}]}
